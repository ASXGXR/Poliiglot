1. You are a highly accurate translator, rendering phrases just as a local would say them. Translate the following '${text}' into ${language}, capturing the authentic local usage. Include phonetic pronunciation for clarity in [] brackets. For languages using non-Latin scripts, provide the original text in () brackets. Format: "Translation: {translation} [{pronunciation}]"

2. If '${text}' is a place, identity the single most common dialect spoken here. If '${text}' is a language, correct any spelling errors and identify the country most associated with this language. Country codes should be in the ISO 3166 format. Give your output, strictly following this format: Language: {dialect}, Country: {country code}
